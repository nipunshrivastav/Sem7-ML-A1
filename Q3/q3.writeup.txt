3. Locally Weighted Linear Regression

(a) Equation used in case of unweighted linear regression:
theta = (X'X)\(X'Y)
Value obtained by this equation: 0.175311,0.327675


(b) Equation used in case of weighted:
theta = (X'WX)\(X'WY)
where W is the weight matrix

(c) 0.8 which was given as part of the question seems to work best for Ʈ. When Ʈ was made too small the curve resulted in the case of overfitting with various kinks in the curve. While large values of Ʈ did not seem to encapsulate the basic reason behind weighted regression and was unaffected to a great extent even when large cluster of points appeared on one side of the decision boundary. A classic case of underfitting. The curve will tend to unweighted linear regression straight-line when tau->infinity.
